The environmental economy encompasses activities and products that serve either of two purposes: ‘environmental protection’ — that is, preventing, reducing and eliminating pollution or any other degradation of the environment or ‘resource management’ — that is, preserving natural resources and safeguarding them against depletion. EGSS accounts provide information on production (output) and export of environmental goods and services and the related employment and gross value added.\n"
