**Experimental statistics on structure of the multinational enterprise groups**

In an effort to better respond to users' needs, Eurostat publishes Experimental statistics on the related Eurostat website based on the EuroGroups Register (EGR) data. The EGR is part of the EU statistical infrastructure and has been built up to better capture globalisation effects as well as for improving the consistency of national data on enterprise groups.

**Data source**

To produce the experimental statistics, the data source is the EGR, the central statistical business register of Eurostat and the EU and European Free Trade Association (EFTA) countries' statistical authorities.

**Background data table**

The _SQL_ source code in the file [_egr_groups.sql_](egr_groups.sql) retrieves microdata source populations from the data base and builds table with generated information on breakdowns required to produce experimental statistics for the publication.  

**The SQL code**

The _SQL_ code shared here was used to produce the tables and graphics for the _Statistics Explained_ publication on the [*Structure of multinational enterprise groups in the EU*](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php?title=Structure_of_multinational_enterprise_groups_in_the_EU). This article gives an overview of the structure of multinational enterprise groups in the EU in 2016.

Every single table/figure presented in the article can be generated by running the corresponding source file and using microdata from the EGR, _e.g._ the _SQL_ source code in the file [_egr_figure4.sql_](egr_figure4.sql) will enable you to reproduce the [figure #4](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explainedOvervie/index.php?title=File:Top_5_EU_partner_countries_in_which_the_groups_of_country_have_the_highest_share_of_employment_in_2016.png) of the statistics explained article.
